# SELeNa

SEarch for LeNsed AGN

Type make to build these executables
* *cluster* : Search for clusters of celestial objects.
* *contaminant* : Produce a set of fortuitous clusters of celestial objects in a given magnitude range.
* *dataset* : Build a data set of observations for gravitational lenses identification and characterization based either on simulations of Non-singular Isothermal ellipsoid lens models in presence of an external shear (NSIEg lens models) or based on observations.
* *density* : Compute the density of object on the celestial sphere based on triangles from the Hirarchical Triangular Mesh
* *ert* : Extremely Randomized Trees supervised learning models building and predictions
* *htmid* : Compute the HTM identifiers of object on the celestial sphere
* *pconvert* : Astronomical coordinates converter.
* *pgrid* : Build a probability grid based on the two dimensional histograms of the input values or predict probabilities based on a built grid.
* *simulation* : Simulate gravitational lens configurations based on a non-singular isothermal ellipsoid (NSIEg) lens model in presence of an external shear (Kormann, 1994).
* *split* : Find an hyperplane that split at best a learning set of observations regarding a given binary class.
* *xmatch* : Perform a cross match between celestial objects.
