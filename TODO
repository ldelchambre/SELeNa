- Implement an ANN program that optimize an artificial neural network through backpropagation
	The topology file should look like this
	(0,0) sig(2)
	(1,0) tanh(5) <- (0,0) 1.58
	(1,1) sig(3)  <- (0,0) 0.25
	(2,1) sig(1)  <- (1,0) 1.00, (1,1) 1.00
	Format is the following:
	(x,y) fct(arg) <- (x0,y0) w0, ...
	where (x,y)    is the position of the perpectron in the network
	      fct(arg) is the activation function to use with the given parameter(s)
	      (x0,y0)  is the input this perceptron receive from neuron at (x0,y0)
	      w0       is the initial weight associated with the (x0,y0) input

Allow input coordinates of the form Jhhmmss+ddmmss.

xmatch
------
 	- Add --degree and --radian options specifying which unit is used by default
 	- Add the possibility to do a cross match with different radius for each observation

cluster
-------
 	- Allow a "--buffer" option, storing input lines in a temporary file rather than in memory
  - Compute the cluster size and difference in colours as output
